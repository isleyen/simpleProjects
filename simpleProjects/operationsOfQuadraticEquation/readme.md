Since our equation is in "ax^2 + bx + c = 0" type, we get a,b,c information from the user and the roots are calculated.

## What is program code?

Firstly, we defined libraries.

In the "main" function:

+ We got values ​​from user.
+ We calculated the discriminant.

> [!WARNING]
> If delta < 0, there is *no real root*.

> [!NOTE]
> It has no real root but it has imaginary root. The *imaginary root* is calculated as follows:

## How do you use this program?

- [x] Open a c++ file in code editor.

- [x] Transfer the code in the "main.cpp" file.

- [x] Finally, run the code :)


__Target File__: main.cpp
